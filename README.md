# Polar Codes : Encoding and Decoding

Welcome to the Polar Codes Encoding and Decoding project implemented in Python. This project provides a comprehensive implementation of Polar Codes, which are adopted by 5G communication systems as a channel coding scheme for control channels.

## Encoding Methods

- **Iterative Encoding**: Efficiently handles large datasets by optimizing recursive stack usage.
- **Recursive Encoding**: Offers a deeper insight into the algorithm and enhances code structure understanding.

## Decoding Methods

- **Successive Cancellation (SC) Decoding**: A hard decision decoding scheme that provides a fundamental yet effective approach to decoding Polar Codes.
- **Successive Cancellation List (SCL) Decoding**: Advanced soft decision decoding method that enhances accuracy by exploring multiple paths and pruning unnecessary ones.

## Error Detection

- **Integrated Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**: Combined with SCL decoding, it minimizes errors and ensures reliable message reception.
